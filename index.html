<h1>Playing with web development</h1>

<p>My name is Jeremey and I am trying to learn how to code.
For me the concept is difficult to understand, because I deal with hardware, not software.
I know how to build and configure a server how I like, but I want to write my own code for the company I work for and show off a unique ability.
I know the basic functions, but I do not know the different variables like <code>document.getElementById()</code>, how would I know to use those commands?
I am trying to find basic console programs to build to practice and learn javascript, but they are either too easy(HelloWorld), or too hard. I cannot find a good in-between level of difficulty.
Is it me? Am I just not grasping the concept fast enough? I don't know and that is why I am building this webpage :) </p>
